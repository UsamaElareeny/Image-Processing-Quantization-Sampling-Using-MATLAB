# Image Processing: Quantization & Sampling Using MATLAB
## Description
This project explores the concepts of quantization and sampling in image processing using MATLAB. It includes MATLAB scripts that resize an image to different dimensions (sampling) and reduce the number of intensity levels in an image (quantization). The project provides a visual demonstration of these processes to help understand their effects on digital images. The motivation behind this project was to gain a deeper understanding of fundamental image processing techniques. Quantization and sampling are crucial operations in many image processing applications, including compression, enhancement, and analysis. By implementing and visualizing these techniques, the project aims to solidify theoretical knowledge with practical examples.

## Installation
You just need to have MATLAB installed and working!!
## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Runt the MATLAB Script: Open 'main.m' in MATLAB to see the examples and visualizations.
## Features
The project contains two main features, or shall I call them blocks. The first block is concerned about the effects of reducing the the sampling levels, which are represented by the the pixels of the image. The second block manipulates the image by reducing the quantization levels (the possible colors of the image) of the picture. Refere back to the attached documentation for more context. 
## Tests
You can insert images filled with more visual elements than the attached image (My Uni Logo, btw)!!
